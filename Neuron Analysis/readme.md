# Neuron Analysis with Python: Exploratory Data Analysis, Clustering, and Regression

Description:
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of neuron data using Python, focusing on exploratory data analysis (EDA), 
clustering, and regression tasks.

Key Features:

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): 
Dive deep into the neuron dataset to uncover patterns, relationships, and potential insights. 
Utilize Python's powerful libraries like NumPy, Pandas, scipy.stats, statsmodel.api and Matplotlib for data manipulation, visualization, and statistical analysis.
- Linear Regression: Perform linear regression analysis to model relationships between neuron attributes and dependent variables. 
- Random Forest Regression: Utilize the random forest regression to predict the total surface area of a neuron.
- Clustering Analysis: Employ various clustering algorithms, such as K-means and BIRCH, to group neurons based on their similarities.
Discover distinct neuron subtypes or clusters, facilitating further research on their characteristics and functions.
